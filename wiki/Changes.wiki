Version 1.0.7 (January 22, 2008)
Change log:
 * Bug fixes: Fixed error for pictures that have been imported before Version 1.0.6
 * Bug fix: GUI bugs with misplaced buttons, wrong theme backgrounds
 * Bug fix: GPS data was corrupted when Geotagging was made with different program. Should now work for all Tools (e.g.: Robogeo, Picopolo, Panorado).
 * Added German language support for the new features
 * When importing, Geotagging is not done automatically anymore. An extra button has been added in the Image Option group for this purpose. With this change it is possible to keep GeoTags that have already been created by other tools.

Version 1.0.6 (January 15, 2008)
Change log:
 * Implementation of Import functionality (see description)
 * Special characters ("äöüéàè...") are supported now editing Title and Comment of a picture
 * The GPS format of the ST setting will be used for the GPS data property in the List view
 * The elevation unit of ST settings will be used for the altitude property in the List view
 * The dateTimeFormat of the CultureInfo will be used for the dateTime property in the List view

Version 1.0.5 (October 30, 2007)
Change log:
 * Fixed bug with EXIF GPS data for negative Longitutes (Thanks to Racefern!)
 * Enhanced video options: Added a slider for current position + volume control
 * Enhanced GUI functions: Click on video in Album view will play the video, DoubleClick on image will open the image with Windows standard viewer

Version 1.0.4 (October 25, 2007)
Change log:
 * Fixed bug when editing Titles and Comments for Video files
 * Added Column "Type" in the List view

Version 1.0.3 (October 24, 2007)
Change log:
 * Cosmetic GUI changes
 * Fixed problem is image directory does not exist
 * Implemented display of videos (avi and wmv)
Still in a very early stage, therefore kind of hidden, for testing it: Import selected -> choose *.avi or *.wmv files
In the album view, click on the black image with the string “video” inside to display it. Then, the video options should pop up, where it is possible to choose play, pause and stop. These options will be extended if there is a positive feedback. Please report errors.
One open point is a way to grab the first frame of the video as a .jpg image. I haven’t found a working solution so far. I would be glad if anyone could help!

Change log:
 * Minor GUI changes
 * Selection of multiple files
 * Implemented Altidue

Version 1.0 (October 17, 2007)
