[b]Installation [/b]
To install, unzip the downloaded zip file in the SportTracks plugin directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Zone Five Software\SportTracks 2.0\Plugins). 

[b]Description [/b]
The plugin is made for accessing pictures that have been taken during an activity in a comfort way.

Currently the plugin contains the following functions:
- Automatic import of pictures into an activity based on the EXIF data.
- Automatic Geotagging based on the GPS track of an activity.
- Two different views are implemented (Album view, List view)

In the album view, only the images are displayed. There are the following options:
- When clicking on an image, it will be opened using the windows image viewer.
- When scrolling on an image, the size will be changed
- When hovering over an image, the tooltip will show the date and time, as well as the GPS location and the picture title.
 

In the list view, thumbnails & metadata of the image are displayed. (e.g.: Title, DateTime, Filepath, CameraModel, GPSLocation,...)
The metadata of the picture will be saved and changed if the cell is being edited (not all cells are editable).

[b]Localization[/b]
Currently the languages English and German are supported. Further languages will be added on request

[b]Data storage[/b]
When a picture is added, a unique referenceID will be created and an image of reduced size (<150kb) will be saved in the folder: "..Web files\Images\"
The path of the original image + the referenceID (unique GUID) that will be created for each image will be saved in the logbook.

[b]Caveats [/b]
There is no way to show anything on the map with the current SportTracks API. As soon as the SportTracks API will allow it, there will be a way to show the images on the map (e.g. when hovering a picture). Admin has already promised to implement this function in the API
